1) For circuit6, the bicg algorithm needs 2 more iterations to converge. Ask the assistants if that is an issue, should we add more iterations, etc.
2) Have files with the known correct solution for each circuit (4,5,6,7,spd) so that we dont have to re-run or use spice every time
    This includes not only the .op files, but the gnuplot inputs as well
3) Calculate the preconditioner elements once, before the loop in cg and bicg. Currently they are calculated every time the preconditioner is called
4) Maybe create separate functions for some of the linear algebra operations
5) I have commented out the command that calls gnuplot, so add it back
6) Free the memory
