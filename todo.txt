Algorithm for DC sweep:

Check if it is i or v
If it is i:
                we have the component pointer in the list. we find the poisitive and negative node indexes, we find their node indexes in the hashtable
                and we changetthe respective element in b

Ifit is v:
                We have the component pointer. We get the m2_i index and we add nodes - 1. This is the respective elementin the b vector
